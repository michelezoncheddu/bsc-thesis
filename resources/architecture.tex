\chapter{Architecture}
The MoVEAS project can be split into two major components: the client-side part, collecting and filter sensors' data, and the server-side one, receiving and manage that data.

\section{Client-side}
The data collected from the Photon basically flowed like as shown in the following schema:

As shown in the chapter \ref{Madgwick filter}, the Madgwick filter does not need Kalman filtered data\dots

\section{Server-side}
